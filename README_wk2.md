D3 Foundations Chart
---------------------

The attached visualization is a scatter plot that I created using D3. It is not completed yet and I am still working on some details. I found that it is kind of hard for me to grasp the concept of using a function to return what I want, especially with the idea of an "i". I will be asking for help from some peers and see if I can figure it out, and post the image once I am complete

update: I put wrapped d the function with () and it worked, so I am not sure what happened, but this is it!

Here is an image of how that displays:
