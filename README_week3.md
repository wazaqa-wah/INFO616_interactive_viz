D3 Foundations Chart
---------------------

The attached visualization is a bar chart that I created using D3. I used NYC Park Pool data and compiled a simple csv file with bourough names and the amount of park pools in each bourough. I then tried to create a bubble chart, but encountered some issue. I hope we can discuss this in class, and if not, I will stay behind and try to figure out this issue with my professor.


Here is an image of how that displays:
