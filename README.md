# INFO616_interactive_viz
Hi hi hi, this new repo is the Fall 2022 Programming Interactive Visualization class. My name is Ziqi and I hope that through this class I can learn a lot of new stuff about D3, create some cool visualizations, and make a fun project in the end. I do not have a coding background, especially the front end of stuff, but I am excited to learn!
