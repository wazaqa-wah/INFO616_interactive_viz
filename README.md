D3 SVG graph chart
---------------------

I first used SVG to create a flower shape, whihc is really fun and interesting. Then I found a document on the state of NY's plants from 2018, and I used numbers from Largest genera in the New York City flora, by number of species from the report. I hoped to create a chart showing the number of genera with colors, but for some reason the graph would not show. I need to figure out whats wrong with it, but attached is the image of the flower that I made

Here is an image of how that displays:
