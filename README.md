Week 8 Homework
===============

Mountain color through 4 seasons
---------------------

For this homework assighment, I tried to create a slider to show how a svg mountain changes color throughout a year. I was able to create the moutain, using a filter for it change from pink to green (spring to summer), but couldn't figure out how to have it changes color multiple times. I feel like I need to cretae a color scheme and then some how append those colors onto the dataset. I wrote some comments in the code on what I coudln't figure out. The attached image is just basically what the page looks like now.

Here is an image of how that displays:
