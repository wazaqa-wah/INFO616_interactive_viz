Week 9 Homework

How to Play Marquise de Cat
---------------------

For this homework assighment, I did a tree diagram of how to play the charater of Marquise de Cat from the boardgame Root. I would also love to turn this project into my final project in developing a webpage that tracks moves and calculate next steps for this boardgame. The issue that I encountered with this homework is that I couldn't figure out how to wrap text for each nodes. I will ask some friends and see if there is a solution.

Here is an image of how that displays:
